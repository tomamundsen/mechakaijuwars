_PLAYTEST_1_

SESSION 1
date: 10/29/2014
start: 12:00am
stop:3:45aam (player1 is next)
notes:
- player 2 has paper clip, player 1 does not
- half the time was actually finishing the prototype (unforseen work that hadn't been done)
- take half of the duration because I was playing myself
- estimated 38 minutes playtime per player so far (1/3 factor for 2 players and 1 GM)
    - learning game
    - playing both players
    - clunky paper prototype instead of streamlined tablet video game
- I've been getting spell/enchantment flooded (especially with the Defensive + Technology deck), put less spells in a deck

SESSION 2
date: 10/30/2014
start: 10:10pm
stop: 1:00am (player 2 is next)
notes:
- spell/enchantment flooding is still a thing
- game is really tedious to play without a computer doing everything
- estimated 56 minutes playtime per player so far (1/3 factor for 2 players and 1 GM)
- seeing modified units is pretty fun and surprising
- destroying buildings feels gratifying because you also level up at the same time
    - juice the animation and sound here!
- there are so many rules to keep in mind that I am missing some
- player 1 has 6 Buildings and player 2 has 5 Buildings
- the decks actually feel somewhat balanced
- 'control target monster/robot' feels VERY strong
- player 2 captured the extra building #21 -> advantage
- no one has poached any leveling yet (i am forgetting to)
- player 1 has 13 units in play and player 2 has 16 units in play
- a total of 29 units in play is quite a bit
    - it doesn't feel like too many
- only the calculations feel tedious, game is fun underneath
- can't wait to play the digital version!
- there is a lot you can't do with paper format
    - can't hide mines
    - can't submerge submarines
    - can't have Fog of War
        - ***game plays much differently with FoW -> scouting***
        - no hiding in the forest
    - can't have stealth

SESSION 3
date: 11/1/2014
start: 1:10pm 
stop: 3:10pm
notes:
- player 2 won!
- player 1 had buildings #11-20, only #11 left
- player 2 had buildings #1-10, 4 and 6 were left
- #21 was neutral at the top of the map, player 2 destroyed it
- estimated 40 minutes playtime per player 
- estimated 134 minutes playtime per player total
    - would be much quicker on a computer => 25% time would be 30 minutes, desired
- spells are appreciated more late game -> makes sense
- player 2 destroyed player 1's HQ -> player 1 even had a creature that regenerated HQ power, but it got hit twice, once by a medium tank
- the game feels really awesome at the end -> pacing: game just gets faster and faster as game goes on
- I didn't use the terrain chart for movement much. i guessed most of the time
